##  Overview

The LLM-Poster-Recommender project is a web application that provides users with personalized poster recommendations. By utilizing OpenAI's text embedding model and cosine similarity, it allows users to search and recommend similar posters based on query text or selected poster titles. The application displays the results in a scatter plot and a table, making it easy for users to explore and find relevant posters. The project also includes a module for loading and processing tabular data, obtaining embeddings using the OpenAI API, and performing dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE. Overall, the LLM-Poster-Recommender project simplifies the search and discovery process for users, providing them with tailored and relevant poster recommendations.

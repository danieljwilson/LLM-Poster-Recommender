##  Overview

LLM-Poster-Recommender is an innovative project that aims to enhance the poster selection process by providing users with personalized recommendations. With the help of deep learning techniques, this codebase generates poster embeddings, which represent the unique characteristics of each poster. Users can search for posters based on keywords or selected titles, and the code fetches and displays similar posters. Additionally, it leverages t-SNE dimension reduction to create a scatter plot, visually demonstrating the similarity between the posters. By integrating machine learning algorithms, LLM-Poster-Recommender offers a valuable solution for individuals and businesses seeking efficient poster exploration and discovery.

##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  | The project's architecture consists of several code files that contribute to the overall functionality. It includes code for generating poster embeddings and code for searching and displaying similar posters based on input keywords or selected titles. The architecture utilizes an API for text embeddings and applies dimensionality reduction techniques using PCA and t-SNE. |
| üî© | **Code Quality**  | The code quality and style are not mentioned in the provided codebase details. |
| üìÑ | **Documentation** | The extent and quality of documentation are not mentioned in the provided codebase details. |
| üîå | **Integrations**  | The key integration in the project is the use of an API for obtaining text embeddings. It also has dependencies on various external libraries, including HTTPX, Pillow, Altair, Plotly, Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and more. |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | The codebase appears to be modular as it consists of separate code files for different functionalities, such as generating embeddings, processing data, and searching/displaying similar posters. This modularity promotes code reusability. |
| üß™ | **Testing**       | The testing frameworks and tools used are not mentioned in the provided codebase details. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**   | The efficiency, speed, and resource usage of the project are not mentioned in the provided codebase details. |
